    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome! I am a Research Group Leader at the Center of Combined Smart Energy Systems at the Technical University of Munich. My work focuses on the intersection of power systems, control theory, and data science to enable the transition to a fully renewable energy future.
      <br><br>
      I completed my PhD (Dr.-Ing.) with magna cum laude from TUM, where my thesis explored the design and application of a Power Hardware-in-the-Loop laboratory for active distribution grids. Before that, I worked as an Electrical Engineer at Rio Tinto in Western Australia.

    <h2>CoSES Laboratory</h2>
    <p>
      The Center of Combined Smart Energy Systems (CoSES) is a unique, multi-energy system laboratory. It allows us to investigate the coupling of electrical, thermal, and gas grids in a controlled environment. My research group utilizes the lab's state-of-the-art Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) capabilities to validate novel control strategies for smart inverters, heat pumps, and EV chargers.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond my core research, I am passionate about making complex engineering concepts accessible to a broader audience. I believe that effective science communication is crucial for driving policy change and public engagement in the energy transition.
      <br><br>
      In my free time, I enjoy hiking in the Bavarian Alps, exploring new programming languages, and contributing to open-source projects that accelerate the adoption of renewable energy technologies.
